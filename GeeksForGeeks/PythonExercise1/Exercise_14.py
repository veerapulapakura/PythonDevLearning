# Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
#
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#
# Hello world!
# Then, the output should be:
#
# UPPER CASE 1
# LOWER CASE 9

word = input()
upper,lower = 0,0

for i in word:
    if 'a'<=i and i<='z' :
        lower+=1
    if 'A'<=i and i<='Z':
        upper+=1

print("UPPER CASE {0}\nLOWER CASE {1}".format(upper,lower))
